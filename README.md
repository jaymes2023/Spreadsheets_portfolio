This is a live tracker that tracks the sales of products sold in XYZ company.

It self updates immediately new order details are entered.

The sheet includes the following tabs:

1. The **Retention** tabe which acts as the dashboard. This constantly captures the total registered subscribers and the number that have subscribed. It also captures the gross revenue, discunts and net revenue of each products sold. A chart displaying each product performance and another chart showing the revenue generated. And finally, It calculates the average retention of the total subscribers to the total subscribed.
2. The subscription tab captures the total revenue generated by day and a drop-down list is available for the user to select any of the previous days for further analysis. A chart is available to present a picture of the daily revenue generated.
3. 3 extra tabs are created for each product. Their respective subscribers are populated on each sheet. The status of every subscriber is automatially updated as new sale records are added to the sheet. The new sales recorded are added to the activity sheet.
